- Write up results for all 2538 Miras that were fit using Censoring LS code.  Preliminary figures have been made, but a full write-up needs to be done.

- Further astrophysical validation of the estimated Mira P-A relationship.  Maybe split the LMC objects from the galactic plane Miras to see if any strong relationship pops out.  

- Other papers omit Miras where no trough in the LC was observed; we should compare our inferences to theirs (Hipparcos, NSVS, OGLE & MACHO data, papers in repo).

- Comparison to the periods provided by ASAS for all the Miras

- Maybe do something with the simulated Mira, though I'm inclined to omit this.

- Better justification of priors, and/or evaluation of sensitivity to priors.

- Sections 2 & 3 look pretty good (though we should elaborate in section 2 about why we are doing this).  However, the Introduction section is a mess & can use lots of cleaning. 

- We should show an example early on in the paper of a variable star whose period gets horribly mis-estimated by not accounting for non-detections, and gets correctly estimated by our method.  This will certainly grab the reader's attention.

- Develop a way to use this for selection of variability, though this may be another paper as it requires development of criteria for finding variability.
