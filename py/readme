we are implementing model for dealing with censoring


Hey guys,

I've been looking through the draft, being impressed, being confused
(particularly by equation 9 which I'm trying to understand)...

The Normal priors on the uncertainty scale parameters seem strange,
particularly as they have mass below 0.  I would take something
conjugate, gamma family or something, instead.  Also, the Jeffrey's
prior on a standard deviation, is 1 / standard deviation.  Perhaps
that should be used somewhere.
